Hereâ€™s a **short description** and a **README.md** you can use for your DinoCaptcha project ðŸ‘‡

---

### Short Description

**DinoCaptcha** is a lightweight, browser-based CAPTCHA alternative inspired by the Chrome Dino game. Users must jump over obstacles three times in a mini-game to prove they are human. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it works as a fun and interactive verification method.

### README.md

```markdown
# DinoCaptcha ðŸ¦–ðŸŒµ

DinoCaptcha is a browser-based CAPTCHA system inspired by the Chrome Dino game.  
Instead of solving puzzles or checking boxes, users play a short mini-game:  
jump over three cactuses to prove you're human.  

---

## Features
- ðŸ¦– Dino jumps with a smooth animation  
- ðŸŒµ Randomly spaced cactuses (scaled 1.25x larger than default)  
- âœ… Pass after successfully avoiding 3 obstacles  
- ðŸ’€ Game Over screen with **Retry** option  
- ðŸŽ® Runs in a modal window, triggered by a "Verify Captcha" button  

---

## How It Works
1. User clicks **"Verify Captcha"** button.  
2. A modal window opens with a mini-game.  
3. User controls the dino using the **Jump!** button.  
4. If the user avoids 3 cactuses â†’ âœ… "Captcha Passed".  
5. If the dino hits a cactus â†’ ðŸ’€ "Game Over" + Retry option.

## Customization
- Change **number of successful jumps** required by editing:
  ```js
  if (score >= 3) {
      isAlive = false;
      successText.style.display = "block";
  }
````

* Replace `img/dino.png` or `img/cactus.png` with your own sprites.
* Adjust **jump physics** by tweaking:

  ```js
  let velocity = 8;   // jump strength
  let gravity = 0.4;  // fall speed
  ```

---

## Requirements

* Works in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
* No external libraries needed.
